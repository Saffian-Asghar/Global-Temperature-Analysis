## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2023. The analysis utilizes data from three different sources: NOAA, Berkeley Earth, and HadCRUT5. The data is processed, cleaned, and visualized to gain insights into the trends and patterns of global temperature change over time.

## Data Sources

| Dataset | Information | Introduction | Authors | Creators | License Info |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NOAA | The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) provides this dataset, which is based on land and ocean temperature records from multiple sources. | NOAA's Global Surface Temperature Analysis (NOAAGlobalTemp) provides a comprehensive dataset of monthly global surface temperature anomalies from 1880 to the present. The dataset is based on temperature records from over 16,000 land and ocean stations worldwide. | National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) | NOAA Global Surface Temperature Analysis Team | Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) |
| Berkeley Earth | The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature dataset is compiled by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley. | The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature dataset is a reconstruction of global surface temperature history from 1850 to the present. The dataset is based on a comprehensive analysis of temperature data from multiple sources, including weather stations, ships, and satellites. | Robert Rohde, John Abraham, and Roger Pielke Jr. | Robert Rohde | Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) |
| HadCRUT5 | The Hadley Centre for Climate Research at the Met Office provides this dataset, which is based on land and ocean temperature records from multiple sources. | The Hadley Centre Global Temperature Record (HadCRUT5) is a dataset of monthly global surface temperature anomalies from 1850 to the present. The dataset is based on temperature records from over 10,000 land and ocean stations worldwide. | Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Research | Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Research | Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) |


## Methodology

1. Data Acquisition: The data from the three sources is downloaded and stored in appropriate formats.

2. Data Cleaning: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is explored using statistical methods and visualizations to understand the distribution, trends, and patterns of global temperature anomalies.

4. Time Series Analysis: Time series analysis techniques are applied to identify long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in the global temperature data.

5. Visualizations: The findings from the data analysis are presented using various visualizations, including line charts, scatter plots, and maps.

## Conclusion

The analysis of global temperature anomalies reveals a clear and alarming trend of increasing temperatures over time. This trend is consistent across different datasets and methodologies. The findings highlight the urgent need to address climate change and take steps to mitigate its impacts.
