## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2023. The analysis utilizes data from three different sources: NOAA, Berkeley Earth, and HadCRUT5. The data is processed, cleaned, and visualized to gain insights into the trends and patterns of global temperature change over time.

## Data Sources

* **NOAA:** [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global)
* **Berkeley Earth:** [https://berkeleyearth.org/data/](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/)
* **HadCRUT5:** [https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/data/HadCRUT.5.0.2.0/download.html](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/data/HadCRUT.5.0.2.0/download.html)

## Methodology

1. Data Acquisition: The data from the three sources is downloaded and stored in appropriate formats.

2. Data Cleaning: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is explored using statistical methods and visualizations to understand the distribution, trends, and patterns of global temperature anomalies.

4. Time Series Analysis: Time series analysis techniques are applied to identify long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in the global temperature data.

5. Visualizations: The findings from the data analysis are presented using various visualizations, including line charts, scatter plots, and maps.

## Conclusion

The analysis of global temperature anomalies reveals a clear and alarming trend of increasing temperatures over time. This trend is consistent across different datasets and methodologies. The findings highlight the urgent need to address climate change and take steps to mitigate its impacts.
